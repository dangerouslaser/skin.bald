    Kodi only re-applies the display mode when the played stream's HDR type
    changes, and a VS10 switch made mid-playback never tells it about one.  The
    driver then starts sending a different output format while the HDMI output
    is still set up for the one before it, so the TV never switches over and the
    picture comes out with the wrong colours -- most visibly in Player-LED mode.
    Asking the display driver to re-apply its output is the missing step; see
    ``core.display`` for how that is done.

    Which switches need one is the path's answer, not the user's:

    * The built-in sysfs path writes the driver's nodes behind Kodi's back, so
      *nothing* it does is ever signalled -- every mode it moves the output to
      leaves the display set up for the one before it, SDR8 to HDR10 as much as
      SDR to Dolby Vision.  Every switch it takes is reset.
    * The native ``vs10.*`` actions go through Kodi's own VS10 engine, which
      handles the output it knows how to handle; only the Dolby Vision line,
      which no VS10 action re-negotiates the HDMI output for, is left to be
      reset here.

    Both ends of Dolby Vision need it.  TV-LED was held back from the reset for
    a while, on the grounds that tunnelled Dolby Vision negotiates the HDMI
    output itself and that a reset there did harm rather than nothing, leaving
    later switches in the same playback landing on SDR instead of the mode
    picked (issue #64).  What actually caused that was the reset going out over
    a driver that had not finished with the mode before it; now that
    ``_set_passthrough_mode`` waits for the Dolby Vision core to come down
    first, the reset lands on a settled driver and SDR to Dolby Vision and back
    works on both ends.

    The move is confirmed against the driver before anything is re-applied,
    because a mode the driver did not take is a mode the display has nothing to
    re-apply for.  That wait doubles as the settling time a conversion mode
    takes on its own, since ``_set_sdr_conversion_mode`` waits on nothing.
    Playback gates it too, since a switch with nothing on screen has no output
    to re-apply.

    Only kernel 5.15 (CoreELEC 22) feels any of this: the reset is a DRM
    property on the HDMI connector, which the older kernels have no equivalent
    for, so there ``core.display`` finds nothing to drive either way.
