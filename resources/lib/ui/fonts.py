"""Register the overlay's font sizes in the active Kodi skin.

The overlay lays out against two specific sizes (21 for the metadata rows, 32
for the headers), so it registers them in the skin's Font.xml under its own
names.  Both name ``arial.ttf``, which Kodi distributes itself -- nothing is
copied into the skin, so there is no font file that can go missing or drift out
of sync with the entry that names it.

Nothing runs on import.  The service installs the entries at Kodi start and
again whenever a skin is loaded -- a skin switch, a skin update, or the reload
this triggers itself -- so by the time anyone presses the button the work is
long done.  ``ensure_fonts()`` is what the overlay calls on its way up, and it
answers out of the mark the install leaves behind (see PROP_FONTS_READY): one
window-property read and one stat of the Font.xml already known, rather than a
walk of the skin directory and a parse of the file.  That mark names the file
it was taken from, so a Font.xml replaced under a running Kodi -- by an update
that never announced itself, or by anything else -- is caught by the next
launch rather than waiting for a restart.
