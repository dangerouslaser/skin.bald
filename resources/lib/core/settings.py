"""One settings handle per interpreter, renewed only when the settings change.

Kodi gives every ``xbmcaddon.Addon()`` a copy of the settings of its own, and
loads it on the first read: the whole ``resources/settings.xml`` definition --
some 360 KB of XML, every setting with its control, constraints and
dependencies -- is parsed and built up, and the stored values are read over
it.  Code that had to see a change made in the settings dialog mid-session
used to build a fresh ``Addon()`` for every read to get it, and so paid that
load every time: five times a second in the dashboard's producer, four times a
second in the codec-logo splash, twice a second in the overlay's static pass.

The stored values live in one file, which Kodi rewrites whenever a setting
changes -- on leaving the settings dialog and on every ``setSetting()``.  So
the handle is kept, and replaced only when that file's stamp moves: one stat
per call instead of one load, and a change is still seen on the very next call.

A caller that derives something from the settings can compare the handle it
got last time against this one (``is not``) to learn whether they changed.
