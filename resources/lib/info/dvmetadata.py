"""Row model for the Dolby Vision metadata view.

``dvinfo`` picks the handful of readings the overlay has room for and formats
each one for its row.  This module does the opposite: it walks the whole parse
result ``script.module.sidedata`` returns -- flags, structure, the dvcC/dvvC
configuration record, every RPU block from the header through L255, the
composer's own reshaping curves, and the static MDCV / CLL SEIs (plus the
HDR10+ payload when the stream carries one) -- and lays it out as
``(kind, name, value)`` rows for ui.dvmetadata to put in a list.
Nothing is left out and nothing is interpreted: the metadata view is where you go
to see what the bitstream actually says.

Two things are asked for rather than found.  The composer subtree is the one
part of a parse big enough to be worth not building, so it is left out of an
ordinary one and this module asks for it by the frame (see
``info.dvinfo.get_sidedata``) -- the overlay's own polling never pays for it.
And its coefficients are the one reading here that is derived rather than
printed, because the RPU splits each of them into halves that say nothing apart
and the arithmetic that puts them back together is the RPU syntax's own (see
``_coefficient``).

Field names, units and value scalings follow the module's own FIELDS.md, so a
row here reads the same as the documented field it comes from.  Only readings
the bitstream actually carries make it into the list: a field the stream leaves
out is dropped rather than shown as a dash, and a section left with nothing to
say drops with it, so the view is what this stream has rather than a form with
most of its boxes blank.  Everything is read live: the per-frame blocks (L1,
L2, L4, L5, L8) move with the picture, the title-level ones stand still.

Carries what a frame omits, though.  Under DM metadata compression an RPU
refers back to an earlier frame's metadata rather than repeating it, so a block
this stream plainly has -- L2, L8, the source range, the title-level levels --
is missing from most frames of it.  Read strictly frame by frame those sections
would come and go every second or two; instead the last block that arrived
stands until a new one replaces it (see _hold).

Formatting only, apart from the stream labels and the parser version the first
section names, and the held blocks the live path fills in: hand ``build_rows``
a parse result of your own and it yields the same rows anywhere, holding
nothing.

# an empty row.
#
# The empty row is what sets the headings apart.  A Kodi list scrolls by one
