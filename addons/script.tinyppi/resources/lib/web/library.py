"""The film and series library behind the dashboard's idle page.

A box that is playing nothing is the one somebody is standing in front of with
a phone in their hand, and what they want from it is a film.  So the page that
says nothing is playing offers the video database instead: every film Kodi
knows about, as posters, and a press puts one on the television.

The list is read over JSON-RPC once and then held.  A library of a few
thousand films is a query Kodi answers in its own time, and a browser opening
-- or a film ending, which is when every phone in the house asks at once -- is
not a reason to ask again.  What is held is dropped the moment Kodi says the
library changed (see ``service/monitor.py``), so a film added this evening is
on the phone without anyone waiting the hold out.

Dropping it is also announced.  Every screen holds a copy of one of these lists
for as long as it is open, and a copy is wrong the moment a film is watched to
the end or switched off in the middle -- so a number that moves with every drop
rides out with every snapshot (``revision``), and a page or an app that sees it
move reads its list again.  Without it a dashboard left on a television showed
yesterday's answer until somebody reloaded the page.

Only the poster addresses are kept here, never the pictures themselves: a
thousand posters is more memory than the whole add-on has any business taking,
and the browser holds the handful it drew far better than this could (see
``_ART_CACHE`` in ``web/server.py``).

Series are the same shelf with one floor more.  A show is not something that
can be put on -- an episode is -- so the wall of shows is read and held the way
the films are, and the episodes of one show are read only when somebody opens
that show, and then held beside it.  A house that watches three series does not
pay for the episodes of the ninety it does not.
