"""The dashboard's HTTP server: a snapshot producer plus a small read-mostly
API served off the add-on's own port.

One producer thread builds a snapshot on a fixed cadence and every connected
browser is pushed the same one over Server-Sent Events, so five open tabs cost
what one costs -- the alternative, polling per request, would run the whole
side-data pass once per client per tick.

Routes are a fixed table, never a path resolved against the filesystem, and
everything that changes the player's state needs the token.  The server is off
until it is switched on in the add-on settings.

# moved after that.  Almost nothing does: a title's rows are written once and
# then stand for two hours, while the clock and a handful of figures move five
# times a second -- so a delta is a few dozen bytes where the snapshot it
# replaces is tens of kilobytes, which on a phone is the difference between a
# background tab that costs nothing and one that costs a battery.
#
# The two long lists are diffed by row.  Their *shape* -- which cards exist,
# which rows they hold and what those are called -- decides how: unchanged, and
# only the readings that moved are sent; changed at all, and the whole list
# goes, because a page cannot patch rows into a list it does not have yet.
