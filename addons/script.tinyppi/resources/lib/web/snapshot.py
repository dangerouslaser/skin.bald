"""Build the dashboard's data snapshot out of the overlay's own readings.

``info.properties`` reaches its window through nothing but ``setProperty``
(see ``core.utils.set_changed_properties``), so handing it a collector instead
of an ``xbmcgui.Window`` yields exactly the values the overlay draws -- same
formatting, same units, same N/A labels -- without a second copy of the
computation.  Every row the overlay gains is therefore in the dashboard the
moment it is published.

The layout below mirrors ``script-tinyppi-main.xml`` section for section and
reuses its own string IDs, so the dashboard is translated wherever the overlay
is, and a renamed label moves in both at once.
