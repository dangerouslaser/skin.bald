"""Geometry and choices of the VS10 dialog's layouts.

One dialog, three ways of drawing it: the single button, the bar and the
panel the add-on has always had. Which window file each is drawn from,
how large its panel is and therefore how far it may be moved all live here,
so the skin generator in ``tools/gen_dialog_skins.py`` and the dialog itself
work from one description rather than from two that drift apart.

Imported by the generator outside Kodi as well, so everything Kodi supplies
is optional here.
