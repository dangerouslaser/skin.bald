"""Display reset for Dolby Vision output switches.

Kodi re-applies the display mode whenever the played stream's HDR type changes:
``CWinSystemAmlogicGLESContext::CreateNewWindow`` compares the new type against
the old one and, when they differ, forces a mode switch.  That forced switch is
what makes the HDMI output re-negotiate, and it is why a stream that starts as
Dolby Vision reaches the TV as Dolby Vision.

A VS10 output switch made while a stream is already playing never goes through
that path.  Neither the sysfs writes nor the native ``vs10.*`` actions tell Kodi
anything, so the Dolby Vision driver starts sending a different output format
while the HDMI output is still set up for the previous one -- the TV then never
switches to Dolby Vision and the picture comes out with the wrong colours, most
visibly in Player-LED mode.

Since kernel 5.15 the display mode can no longer be set through
``/sys/class/display/mode``; Amlogic disabled that and it now takes a DRM atomic
commit, which only the DRM master may perform.  Kodi is that master -- and
add-ons run inside the Kodi process, so its own DRM file descriptor is reachable
from here.  This module uses it for the one step Kodi's own forced mode switch
falls back to when the mode string itself does not change: setting the Amlogic
``UPDATE`` connector property, which makes the driver re-apply the current
output (``CAMLDRMUtils::aml_set_drmDevice_mode``).

Everything here is best effort.  A kernel without the property, a Kodi build
that does not use DRM, a descriptor that is not the master -- each just means no
reset, never a failed mode switch.
