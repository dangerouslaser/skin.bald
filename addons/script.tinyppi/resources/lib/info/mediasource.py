"""Compose the ``MediaSourceVar`` line shown in place of the old, redundant
"Medienquelle" row (see ``script-tinyppi-main.xml``), which used to just
repeat the Input row in a shorter form.

For a file this reads ``Release-Typ · Container · Groesse`` (e.g.
``Remux · MKV · 42GB``), each part reusing the same tag vocabulary the IMAX
title matching in ``imax.py`` already knows about release names.  While a
live channel, recording or stream plays there is no release tag and nothing
to stat, so the line instead names the transport: ``PVR`` for a PVR item, or
the streaming protocol (HLS/DASH/RTMP/RTSP) for an addon-delivered stream.
Whichever branch runs, an empty result falls back to the same localized
``N/A`` label the DV metadata rows use, so the row is never blank.

A file reached over a network -- smb, nfs, or the plain http(s) a media
server such as Plex or Jellyfin serves it over -- takes the file branch like
any local one, and reads the same three parts off the URL and a VFS stat.
Where that yields nothing, because the server names the file by an opaque
id, the protocol itself (HTTP / SMB / NFS / ...) stands in before N/A does.
The stat is the one part of the row that leaves the box, so it is asked only
where it can be answered: never for an addon-delivered link, whose size means
nothing and whose CDN can sit on the request for seconds (see _statable).

Kodi has no container InfoLabel to ask -- there is no ``VideoPlayer.
Container``, and ``Player.Process`` exposes only decoder and stream readings
-- so the container comes from the played path's file type instead, which
means a stream delivered without one simply leaves that part out.
